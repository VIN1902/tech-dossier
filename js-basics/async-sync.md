# Synchronous Vs Asynchronous
In CS we define:
- synchronous -> one thing at a time, in a strict order, blocking the next task until the first one finishes. (things are waiting for each other in execution)
- asynchronous -> Tasks don't block each other. A slow task can start, but the program moves on to the next task without waiting.

- Synchronous = Must Wait -> freezes execution making it slow
- Asynchronous = Can Move On While Waiting -> fast but difficult to manage

It’s not about whether things are happening simultaneously in real life—it’s about whether they must wait for each other in execution.
