// rest arguments are the function's arguments.

// used when we want to switch context
// say it in hindi: 'greet' function person1 ka tha isliye normally uska hi 'this' value use krega but jab call method chalaya then hum 'this' value (context) ko specifiy kar sakte hai ki kiska use krke person1 ka function 'greet' chalana hai.

first 'iamfirst' gets logged by callstack then remove it
then obj was created and heap (global scope, so keep it until whole program is not done)
then setTimeout() was encountered so send it to browser to start a clock of 3s and register the greet function: function () {console.log(`Hello ${this.personName}`);}
then callstack moves ahead and executes 'iamlast'

now callstack if free so it deletes/removes the obj in heap as global context is over as whole program is over.

then after 3s callback queue recieves greet fn and event loop sends it to callstack to get executed.

now callstack has one new job so a new global context is created (new program one can say losely).
issue is that in this new context 'obj' was never created so no context exits for greet's this value.
hence it returns 'undefined'
