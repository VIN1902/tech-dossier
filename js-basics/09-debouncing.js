}
fn goes in a queue because of setTimeout api, so will execute only after the global execution context of tryingToUnderstand is over. so for that we need to attach context with it using apply. [it loses its original context (this) if it relies on this, That's why, in some cases, you'd need .apply(this, args) to explicitly bind this.]
...args when passed as returned function's parameter is saying 'collect all the arguments in an array called args.
...args when passed as parameter of fn is saying 'spread the args array into individual arguments'.

const tryingToUnderstand = (fn, delay) => {
    return (...args) => {
        fn(...args)
        setTimeout(() => {
        }, delay);
    }
}
here fn doesn't need call,bind,apply cause the execution context when it runs will be in same callsatck as of tyringToUnderstand function.
