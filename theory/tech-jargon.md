# Software Components
1. Library
- Pre-written functions in collection of code files, that can be called to do a specific task without enforcing structure.
2. Package
- Library/s + metadata + configuration files, shared/installed using a package manager (npm, pip).
3. Module
- A single code file (usually) that provides reusable functions, variables, or classes, and can be imported into other files.
4. Framework
- More structured and opinionated (it tells you how to structure) version of library, a framework calls your code unlike a library (inversion of control).
5. Dependency
- Any external package (library, package, module) that a project depends on.
6. Middleware
- A function that runs between the request-response cycle in a client-server setup, modifies the request before sending a response.
7. SDK (s/w development kit)
- Set of libraries/docs/example that are there for a specific platform (android, ios).
